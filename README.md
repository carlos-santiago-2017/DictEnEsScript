# DictEnEsScript

This is a new repository for my old script [trad3](https://github.com/c4arl0s/trad3) that was created back in 2017. It looks for an english word and retrieves its corresponding spanish translation and viceversa, I added in some cases a phrase to use it. It uses my own database which come from my old days of school, when I just needed to understand a word I just looked for it using any resource I found, and put it in a txt file. This txt files when the time went by it becomes a large data base of words. After a while I took [Nathaniel project](https://github.com/nathanielove/English-words-pronunciation-mp3-audio-download) which includes a collection of mp3 files with the pronunciation of english words, then the script reproduce this file right before the word is found. One last stage of the project was to use a google API, which helps you to find any word by means of google translate.
and also make a request to find it in google translate web service in case the word does not exist.
